# This is a small, configurable backup utility for BirdNET Pi installations with or without external storage.

# In no particular order, features that make sense to me:

# TODO
# Files to copy
# birdnet.conf, birds.db, BirdSongs dir
# Other conf files to find go here

# TODO:
# Implement logging functionality to keep a record of each backup's status.

# TODO
# Option to backup entire birdnet dir or filesystem (within reason)

# TODO:
# Add support for backing up to various destinations, such as local storage, network attached storage (NAS), or cloud services.

# TODO
# Backup size/date rotation logic and settings

# TODO:
# Include a configuration file parser to handle different installation setups.

# TODO:
# Provide a command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction and configuration of the backup process.

# TODO:
# Verify the integrity of the backup after the process completes.

# TODO:
# Implement a mechanism to notify the user of the backup status (e.g., email, push notification).

# TODO:
# Develop a strategy to handle backups when BirdNET Pi is actively recording or processing data.

# TODO:
# Incorporate error handling to manage permissions issues, disk space problems, and other potential errors.

# TODO:
# Include an option for the user to encrypt backups for security purposes.

# TODO:
# Design a recovery plan or script to restore BirdNET Pi from backups easily.

# TODO:
# Schedule backups using cron jobs or other scheduling services.

# TODO:
# Provide an exclusion list feature to exclude specific files or directories from the backup.

# TODO:
# Allow for backup compression to save disk space.

# TODO:
# Create a cleanup function to remove old backups based on retention policy.

# TODO:
# Develop a pre-backup and post-backup hook system for custom user scripts.

# TODO:
# Ensure cross-version compatibility for backing up and restoring between different versions of BirdNET Pi.

# TODO:
# Add a progress indicator for the backup process to inform the user of the current status.

# TODO:
# Implement a dry-run feature that simulates the backup process without actually copying files.
