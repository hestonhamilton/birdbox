# birdbox README

## Introduction
This README provides guidance for building a BirdNET Pi Real-Time Acoustic Bird ID Station using a Raspberry Pi.

## Materials
- Raspberry Pi (4B/3B+/0W2) - [Search for approved Pi resellers here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/resellers/?q=)
- Waterproof Project Box - [Example used in project](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085QCT543)
- 64GB Micro SD Card - [Example used in project](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09W9XYQCQ)
- Heatsink with Fan - [Example used in project](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Z3Q417K)
- Waterproof/Outdoor Ethernet Connector - [Example used in project](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PH4GL2F)
- Waterproof/Outdoor USB 3.0 Cable - [Example used in project](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079957VC3)
- USB Microphone - [Example used in project](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCKGLTP)
- PoE to USB-C Adapter - [Example used in project](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087F4QCTR)

## Setup Steps
1. Install BirdNET-Pi software on the micro SD card. Official installation guide [here](https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/wiki/Installation-Guide).
2. Connect the PoE adaptor to the Raspberry Pi.
3. Install the fan on the Raspberry Pi.
4. Mount the Raspberry Pi in the waterproof box.
5. Connect cables to the Raspberry Pi and power it with a PoE Ethernet cable.

## Usage
The system records and analyzes audio using BirdNET-Lite for bird identification and supports live streaming and BirdWeather integration.
Instructions for requesting a BirdWeather ID to join the BirdWeather network can be found in the installation guide.
